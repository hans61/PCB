External MCP23S17 test board
============================
It's a small PCB with the MCP23S17 (SPI I/O extension). It has 16 LEDs on both 8 bit ports. The ports are brought out on 2x5 pin headers and the SPI bus with power supply is connected via 2x6 pin headers. The pin assignment is compatible with the original extension. Important!!! When operating on the Gigatron, the 10k pull-up resistor must not be fitted.
