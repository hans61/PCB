Video repeater + expansion for the Gigatron TTL computer
========================================================
The extension combines the "Video Repeater" from Axelb and the "RAM + SPI Expansion" from lb3361 with an MCP23S17 (I/O expander) on one PCB. The 74x377 (U37), the RAM U36 and the PIN A15 are adapted from the mainboard. The extension is tested. The planned control of the video mode via the MCP23S17 does not work. (Wrong thinking in the circuit)
